======= Creating Database =======
Database is created automatically within the program by running the program (explain in the first minute of the video). 

======== Running Project ========
This is a CLI project that requires no setup. Run the Java application via command line or IDE with no arguments, and the required information will be requested of you via the interface. The database will be initialized and ran appropriately. 

**** if you are running this in CMD ***
1. make sure you first change directory with CMD to where all the source code is (e.g. cd C:\Users\arnol\Documents\School Files\SER322\Deliverable 4\source_code\src although your might be different depending on where the source code is extracted to)
2. then do: javac Main.java
3. then java Main
4. prooceed by providing the correct DB information tha is required by the UI

** if you are using a IDE **
The source code doesn't need to be place in a specific package as it is meant to be place in the default package 

=========== Execution ===========
JDBC library is required.
